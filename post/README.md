## Python Scripts for Post-Processing

This directory hosts a collection of Python scripts designed for post-processing tasks. For optimal functionality, execute the scripts prefixed with "ParaView_" within the ParaView environment. Please note that running some scripts in ParaView may take time; ensure you wait until the process is completed. Additionally, this folder includes an example of the expected output when using ParaView.

The Python scripts can be used for Li-Mg and Li-Zn case studies.
